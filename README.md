##Info
A Personal Project where I am creating a GPA application with the Java programming language.
Goal: To create an application that allows a user to customize and calculate class grades in terms of weights, dropped grades, and other common procedures through a graphical user interface.

##**Update 2/5/2016**
***
- Re-factored code in such a way that multiple frames were not created.
- Menus need to be re-implemented.
- Moved to current repository.

##**Update 2/1/2016**
***
- Re-factored code into separate classes.
- Maintained functionality already present.
- Navigation between all 3 frames is possible.
- Added temporary application icon.


##**Update 1/17/2016**
***
- Currently 2 frames (Added 3rd Frame)
  - GPA_Gui (Initial Frame)
    - One large tab pane with various panels in BoxLayout.
    - Classes are right-click capable, producing a pop-up menu.
